### Requirements

#### **Core Features:**
1. **Search Functionality:** Users can search for products by name or loose description of the product. Searchbox will be present and workable on all pages.
2. **Product Recommendations:** Display product recommendations specifically tailored for user.
    - Identify similar or related products - shown on product detail pages.
    - Identify complementary products - shown on cart page.
3. **Live User Profiles:** Enable users to build their own carts and receive personalized recommendations.
4. **Historic User Profiles:** Users can select an existing historical account and see what recommendations they would receive.
6. **Responsive Design:** Ensure full usability across desktop. Mobile can be a lower priority.
  
  
#### **Non-Functional Requirements:**

- High availability (99.9% uptime Sunday through Friday).
- Uses free or extremely low-priced cloud services to accomplish core features.
- Does not rely entirely on any premium LLM API (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) as the core solution. As a supportive tool is fine, but not main solution.
